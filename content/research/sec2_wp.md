We construct a novel physical risk factor by forming a portfolio of REITs, long on those with properties more exposed to climate risk and short on those less exposed. Combined with a transition risk factor, we assess the climate risk exposure of P&C and life insurance companies in the U.S. Insurers can be exposed to climate-related physical risk through their operations and transition risk through their $12 trillion of financial asset holdings. We estimate insurers’ dynamic physical and transition climate beta, i.e. their stock return sensitivity to the physical and transition risk factors. Validating our approach, we find that insurers with larger exposures to risky states have a higher sensitivity to physical risk, while insurers holding more brown assets have a higher sensitivity to transition risk. Using the estimated betas, we calculate the expected capital shortfall of insurers under various climate stress scenarios.

We propose a novel approach to estimate banks' credit exposures to transition risks using sectoral effects of climate policies from general equilibrium (GE) models. At worst, estimated exposures reach 14% of bank loan portfolio values. Average exposures drop below 2% after incorporating information on loan payoff structures. Emissions only explain 60% of the variation in our estimated exposure measure, suggesting that our measure captures aspects of transition risk unique to GE models. Consistent with managing their exposures to transition risk, banks joining the Net-Zero Alliance reduced their exposures compared to other banks, mainly by decreasing lending to the riskiest industries.

 In a model with agents facing constraints heterogeneous across economies, we provide a novel explanation for an understudied yet economically significant deviation from the Law of One Price across FX forward markets. Specifically, we document a substantial divergence between the exchange rate for locally traded forward contracts and contracts with the same maturity traded outside the jurisdiction of countries during the global financial crisis, and that the magnitudes varied across currencies. The model predicts that (1) the basis increases with the shadow costs of constraints across time and increases with the country-specific FX position limits across countries;  (2) the shadow cost of each constraint non-linearly increases as the intermediary sector's relative performance declines below a threshold; and (3) higher shadow cost of the position limit predicts lower future excess return on local-currency denominated assets, as buying local assets relaxes the FX position limit constraint imposed on the intermediaries. We test the model predictions and find consistent evidence in countries with tight position limits.
