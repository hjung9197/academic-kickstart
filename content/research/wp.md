**Understanding the Onshore versus Offshore Forward Rate Basis: The Role of FX Position Limits and Margin Constraints**  
{{% staticref "files/HJ_Poster.pdf" "newtab" %}}**Poster**{{% /staticref %}} (presented at AFA) | _Draft coming soon_  
During the Great Financial Crisis of 2007--2009, the difference between the exchange rate for locally traded (onshore) forward contracts and that for contracts with the same maturity traded outside the jurisdiction of countries (offshore) increased significantly, though the magnitudes varied across currencies. This deviation from the law of one price can be explained by two constraints imposed on the financial intermediaries: margin constraint and a leverage-based cap on net open FX position (position limit). In an intermediary-based asset pricing model where intermediaries face both margin constraint and position limit constraint, I show how and when the position limit leads to a gap between onshore and offshore forward rates. The model predicts that, first, the shadow cost of margin constraint non-linearly increases as intermediary's consumption share declines below a threshold. Second, the basis increases with the shadow costs of the two constraints across time and increases with country-specific position limit across countries. Third, the model suggests that higher shadow cost of position limit predicts higher future local stock returns, as buying local asset relaxes the position limit constraint imposed on the intermediaries. I test the model predictions and find consistent evidence in the countries with tight position limits.
