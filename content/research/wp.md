**Understanding the Onshore versus Offshore Forward Rate Basis: The Role of FX Position Limits and Margin Constraints**  
During the financial crisis of 2007--2009, the difference between the exchange rate for locally traded (onshore) forward contracts and that of contracts with the same maturity traded outside the jurisdiction of countries (offshore) increased significantly, though the magnitudes varied across currencies. With a model in which financial intermediaries face foreign exchange net position limits and margin requirements, this paper explains the time-series and cross-sectional variation in those price gaps (bases). Within the time-series variation, the magnitude of the bases increases with the shadow cost of the position limit, identified by the interest rate spread between onshore and offshore funding rates. In the cross-sectional variation, the magnitude of bases increases with country-specific position limits and the shadow cost of position limit constraints. I find empirical evidence consistent with the predictions of my model, particularly in the countries with tight position limits.

**Climate Stress Testing** (with Robert Engle) 
Climate change could lead to a systemic risk to the financial sector in the process of an economy transitioning to less carbon-intensive environment. We develop a stress testing procedure to test the resilience of financial institutions to climate-related risks. The procedure involves three steps. The first step is to measure the climate risk factor by using stranded asset portfolio returns. The second step is to estimate time-varying climate beta of financial institutions using Dynamic Conditional Beta (DCB) model. The third step is to compute the systemic climate risk (CRISK), the capital shortfall of financial institutions in a climate stress scenario. This step is based on the same methodology as SRISK, but the climate factor is added as the second factor. We use this procedure to study large banks in the U.S. and the U.K. in the recent collapse in fossil-fuel prices.
