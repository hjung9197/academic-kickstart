{{% staticref "files/HJ_Poster.pdf" "newtab" %}}Poster{{% /staticref %}} (presented at AFA)  
During the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, the difference between the exchange rate for locally traded (onshore) forward contracts and contracts with the same maturity traded outside the jurisdiction of countries (offshore) increased significantly, though the magnitudes varied across currencies. This deviation from the law of one price can be explained by two constraints imposed on financial intermediaries: margin constraint and position limit constraint (a leverage-based cap on net open foreign exchange (FX) position). In an intermediary-based asset pricing model where intermediaries face both margin constraint and position limit constraint, I show how and when the position limit leads to a gap between onshore and offshore forward rates. The model predicts that (1) the shadow cost of margin constraint non-linearly increases as the intermediaryâ€™s consumption share declines below a threshold; (2) the basis increases with the shadow costs of the two constraints across time and increases with the country-specific position limit across countries; and (3) higher shadow cost of the position limit predicts lower future excess return on local-currency denominated assets, as buying local assets relaxes the position limit constraint imposed on the intermediaries. I test the model predictions and find consistent evidence in the countries with tight position limits.
