I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at NYU Stern. My research interests lie in international finance, financial intermediation and asset pricing. My primary research interests regard understanding the impact of frictions in financial intermediaries on asset prices and real economies.

and {{% staticref "files/JMP_HJ.pdf" "newtab" %}}**Job Market Paper**{{% /staticref %}}: The Real Consequences of Macroprudential FX Regulations.


Prior to NYU, I worked as an FX & Rates trader at J.P. Morgan. I earned B.S. in Economics and B.AS from University of Pennsylvania where I graduated _magna cum laude_.
