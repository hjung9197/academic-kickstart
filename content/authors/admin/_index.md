I am a Financial Research Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
My research interests include asset pricing, financial intermediation, household finance, risk management, and international finance. I study the economic risks faced by firms, households, and financial intermediaries, how they manage those risks, and how financial market frictions affect asset prices and real economic outcomes. My research work has been published in top journals, including the *Review of Financial Studies* and the *Journal of Financial Economics*.

I hold a Ph.D. in Finance from NYU Stern, B.S. in Economics from UPenn Wharton, and B.AS from UPenn School of Engineering and Applied Science. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an FX & Rates trader at J.P. Morgan.
